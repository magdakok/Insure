# INSURE

## :movie_camera: https://insure-challenge.netlify.com/

Challenge by [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) to build out a landing page basing on the design (images and svg icons provided).

### My goals:
* build fully responsive website (breakpoints are set wherever the design breaks)
* practise using SASS pre-processor
* write clean and reusable code

### Still to improve:
* classes naming (will use BEM methodology)
* animated mobile navbar
